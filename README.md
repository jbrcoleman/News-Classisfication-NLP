# News-Classisfication-NLP
This week we researched natural language processing (nlp) models. We were given the task of 
researching how to develop a conversational agent or chatbot to assist customer support 
representatives. To work on training an NLP model we used Reuters new data with labels of each text as 
World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. We ran several experiments to test different architectures to use 
for an nlp model. Some of the experiments ran were changing number of layers, methods like LSTM and 
Simple RNN, regularization, and text processing.
